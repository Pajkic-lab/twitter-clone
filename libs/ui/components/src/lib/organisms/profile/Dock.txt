1 Navigation bar should not be nested in Profile component
2 Cover is atom, move it there
3 Avatar and options, avatar should be comp for it self
4 Profile info should be single polymorphic component reused in all app, think it thru
5 i have already saw Tabs somewhere, also should be single component reused


RESEARCH a11y, in combination with linter, its for accessability!!!
How design better frontend; simple, make it most performant

Plan:
    1. start with tabs, make a polymorphic component and use it in all of the app. tab should be atom component and GroupTab should be molecule
    2. profile info component, what to do with this, should we have atom which purpose is going to be just to render plain text???
    3. avatar component
    4. cover should be polymorphic and atom and reused in other places
    5. Navigation bar should be molecule...
    6. Redme file should be adjusted, remove git clone command, and move "Docker has to be running" to section "setup app for development" 
    7. Clean branches locally
