# Getting Involved

Welcome to the **TWC community** 👋

We’re excited to have you here!  
Before you dive into the code, we’d love for you to introduce yourself and connect with others in our **[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Pajkic-lab/twitter-clone/discussions)**.

---

## Introduce Yourself

Head over to the **[Introductions](https://github.com/Pajkic-lab/twitter-clone/discussions/categories/introductions)** category in GitHub Discussions and say hi!  
You can share as much or as little as you’d like — this is your space to connect.

Here are a few ideas you can include in your introduction:

- 🧑‍💻 Who you are (name, background, or what you enjoy working on)
- 🎯 What your goals are — what do you want to learn or improve?
- 🤝 What you’re hoping to contribute or explore in the TWC project
- 💬 Any particular areas of interest (frontend, backend, DevOps, writing docs, design, etc.)

By doing this, we’ll help you find **common ground** with other contributors and suggest **suitable tasks or learning opportunities** that match your goals.

## Engage With the Community

Don’t be shy, jump into ongoing discussions, ask questions, and share your thoughts.  
We value all forms of participation: whether it’s contributing code, helping others, giving feedback, or sharing ideas.

A few quick ways to get started:

- Reply to someone’s introduction with a warm welcome
- Ask for guidance or offer help to others
- Start a small conversation about something you’re curious about

Every message counts — the more we talk, the stronger the community becomes ❤️

## Why This Matters

TWC is more than just a codebase, it’s a collaborative space for learning, growing, and creating together.  
By introducing yourself and engaging in discussions, you become part of a culture of **openness, curiosity, and shared progress**.

Let’s build something meaningful together. 🚀
