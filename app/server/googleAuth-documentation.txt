- using passport -

request lands on controller-specific route 
it triggers guard 
which is going to trigger specific Strategy
which is going to call validate method
validate returns user to controller in (*1) request object "request.user" 

(*1) step in between, probably is this the place where you call serializeUser

serializer is puting user in cokie
deserializer is retriving user from cokie and attach user to request

conclusion so far. passport is doing stuff beneath the hood, it is using request.login() and request.isAutehnticated(), request.logOut()
I don't think is possible to fully grasp what going on...

serializer and deserializer are not ment to be guards/middlewares they are just puting user to cokie and extracting it
you must use protection on every route specific

request.logOut() changes value of cokie so it makes it unusabel, but it remanis in browser as it should
