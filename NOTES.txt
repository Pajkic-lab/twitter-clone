    /*
    * BUGS
    */

- SingleUser image render when resized change shape.
- input type switched from password to text, label for some reason drops down when type is password
- switch from moment.js to day.js
- replace hardcoded values at front with env vars, this should be done last because it will require changes in production envs (
    \twitter-clone\libs\ui\data-access\src\lib\http\client.ts
    \twitter-clone\libs\ui\data-access\src\lib\hooks\auth\index.ts
    ) 


    /*
    * WAITING FOR PROD CHANGE
    */

- node version changed in env file to 20.11.1, change it in prod env
- since you are doing that, there are some hardcoded values in API client and in auth query session name, inject them as envs, and ofc change prod
- thru all app switch userId from number to uuid, same goes for prisma schema


    /*
    * RESEARCH
    */

- datePicker, copy from Athena and see how it works, emphasis is on Generic
- do the same for Pagination
- maybe same for phone input, maybe???
- molecule Table maybe as well there are some generics and might be beneficial 
- Athena, research tables, how are they organized, ...rest in this regard
- after all this is done you should do research everyday of patterns from following resources:
    https://refactoring.guru/
- and after that you should be doing coding challenges daily / or find open source project and contribute to it...

- create separate branch and test out these two libraries 
    https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ts-rest/core
    https://www.npmjs.com/package/nestjs-zod, have to test this library, will DTO validate on front as well in runtime, not sure...
    if these tow libraries can be applied that would greatly improve safety of app. should test it out. When it actually validate on back and on front?

- Should research amplication project backend, make it work on local machine...

    /*
    * TODO
    */

- read finally flex box article

- update user hook
- research split form from submit button!!!

- refactore sidebar and mediabar, no need to have hooks outside

- DO Public Profile

- Do Tooltip to wrap user, to show minified version of public profile page...

- WhoToFollwo should probably be renamed to users list??? and also Follow button is missing, should be optional for users list.

- research editprofile how sticky works?????



-after finishing auth user and social should set base value from 14px to 16px (this should be researched if it's tru at twitter) 
and go thru all design and do changes to be 1 to 1 with wire frames.
