-- it is so entertwind that it makes rely difficult to start refactoring one by one thing, new idea is to start from landing page go thru all components and 
   while doing that to refactor router and way api is triggered and store as well and also to implement RTKQ

- research when to trigger api and how to switch pages 
- router refactor
- should probably switch to RTQ, change should be gradual, they work together just fine.


- research Athena when they use useEffect and what is cleanup function inside it, 
- research all the other hooks and when they are used,

- page refactor
- start refactoring components


- should definitely research generics
    make-form-component-props.type.ts
    http response at back

- should research Pagination Athena component

- research what is a tooltip component

- what is difference between input and input area?
