    /*
    * BUGS
    */

- input type switched from password to text, label for some reason drops down when type is password
- switch from moment.js to day.js
- replace hardcoded values at front with env vars, this should be done last because it will require changes in production envs (
    \twitter-clone\libs\ui\data-access\src\lib\http\client.ts
    \twitter-clone\libs\ui\data-access\src\lib\hooks\auth\index.ts
    ) 
- thru all app switch userId from number to uuid, same goes for prisma schema


    /*
    * RESEARCH
    */

- datePicker, copy from Athena and see how it works, emphasis is on Generic
- do the same for Pagination
- maybe same for phone input, maybe???
- molecule Table maybe as well there are some generics and might be benefitial 
- Athena, research tables, how are they organized, ...rest in this regard
- after all this is done you should do research everyday of patterns from following resources:
    https://refactoring.guru/
- and after that you should be doing coding challenges daily / or find open source project and contribute to it...
