    /*
    * BUGS
    */

- input type switched from password to text, label for some reason drops down when type is password, should create / redesign password input
- replace hardcoded values at front with env vars, this should be done last because it will require changes in production envs (
    \twitter-clone\libs\ui\data-access\src\lib\http\client.ts
    \twitter-clone\libs\ui\data-access\src\lib\hooks\auth\index.ts
    ) 
- fix error handling, rethink how to unify error handling weather it comes from axios or class-validator, 
updateUser has parser build to handle class-validation, research how to do it at backend and just catch it at frontend and render it
- replace userId from increment number to uuid
- button should be redesign
- upload images should be rethink and db schema should be redesign, whole service should be redesign, research this, problem is... I don't store img id 
- error at setAccountModal not rendering pass in manually to input

- FRONTEND mayor bugs, navbar should be redesign and profile navbar should be sticky, mediabar should be sticky as well


    /*
    * WAITING FOR PROD CHANGE
    */

- node version changed in env file to 20.11.1, change it in prod env
- update React version to v19, new version will be released in March or April 2024
- there are some hardcoded values in API client and in auth query session name, inject them as envs, and change prod
- thru all app switch userId from number to uuid, same goes for prisma schema


    /*
    * RESEARCH
    */

- datePicker, copy from Athena and see how it works, emphasis is on Generic
- do the same for Pagination
- maybe same for phone input, maybe???
- molecule Table maybe as well there are some generics and might be beneficial 
- Athena, research tables, how are they organized, ...rest in this regard
- after all this is done you should do research everyday of patterns from following resources:
    https://refactoring.guru/
- and after that you should be doing coding challenges daily / or find open source project and contribute to it...

- create separate branch and test out these two libraries 
    https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ts-rest/core
    https://www.npmjs.com/package/nestjs-zod, have to test this library, will DTO validate on front as well in runtime, not sure...
    if these tow libraries can be applied that would greatly improve safety of app. should test it out. When it actually validate on back and on front?

- Should research amplication project backend, make it work on local machine...

    /*
    * TODO
    */



- when on following page of public profile then click on back it redirects to me following

- prevent navigating to me Id, on click on me it should redirect to profile at backend set exeption to trow if getPublicProfile has the sam userId as me Id


- Read page manager comment how to persist history page...

- (backend) Who to follow returns user who are already being followed 

- Follow button is missing, should be optional for users list.

- Do Tooltip to wrap user, to show minified version of public profile page...

- Can follower and following page be unified, do I need to have 2 pages, can it be settled from params???







-after finishing auth user and social should set base value from 14px to 16px (this should be researched if it's tru at twitter) 
and go thru all design and do changes to be 1 to 1 with wire frames.

- aca review apply
