    /*
    * BUGS
    */

- input type switched from password to text, label for some reason drops down when type is password
- switch from moment.js to day.js
- replace hardcoded values at front with env vars, this should be done last because it will require changes in production envs (
    \twitter-clone\libs\ui\data-access\src\lib\http\client.ts
    \twitter-clone\libs\ui\data-access\src\lib\hooks\auth\index.ts
    ) 


    /*
    * WAITING FOR PROD CHANGE
    */

- node version changed in env file to 20.11.1, change it in prod env
- since you are doing that, there are some hardcoded values in API client and in auth query session name, inject them as envs, and ofc change prod
- thru all app switch userId from number to uuid, same goes for prisma schema


    /*
    * RESEARCH
    */

- datePicker, copy from Athena and see how it works, emphasis is on Generic
- do the same for Pagination
- maybe same for phone input, maybe???
- molecule Table maybe as well there are some generics and might be beneficial 
- Athena, research tables, how are they organized, ...rest in this regard
- after all this is done you should do research everyday of patterns from following resources:
    https://refactoring.guru/
- and after that you should be doing coding challenges daily / or find open source project and contribute to it...


    /*
    * TODO
    */

- Extract globalStyle from redux...
- there is no need for PageLane component, extract Sidebar and Mediabar from it, just keep it for main lane, it will be removed afterwards.
- fix Sidebar when extracted from PageLane
- do Mediabar

- research dependency-cruiser library you installed, it might be useful.

- modals, position icon to center, 
- x icon is to thin
- margins look sketchy
