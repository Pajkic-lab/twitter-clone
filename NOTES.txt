npx nx generate lib <name>


- follow the treed and refactor integration between Frontend and Backend move everything to DTOS lib, add types to http object at front and maybe move http 
to data-access library, at Backend add types to controllers and compiler has to be set to strict

- uncomment compiler options
    // "strict": true,
    // "strictPropertyInitialization": false,
    // "useUnknownInCatchVariables": true,
    // "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,

- eslint plugins: unicorn, prettier, unused-imports, typescript-eslint,        Backend: nest-js, Frontend: react, 

- prettier add dep for auto import sort: prettier-plugin-organize-imports, som options: prettier-plugin-typescript, prettier-plugin-nest-js, prettier-plugin-react

- create new branch and refactor data-access lib to node environment so it can accept redux toolkit. Research this should it be done or maybe its better to keep it as is

- Types at Frontend to be removed and replaced with types from data library, in this scope i need to refactor http object and probably other things.
