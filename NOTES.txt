- refactor router according to Athena pages.ts and routes files

- should restore yup as validation, should research this, zod ux is not that great...


- research Athena when they use useEffect and what is cleanup function inside it, 
- research all the other hooks and when they are used,

- page refactor
- start refactoring components


- should definitely research generics
    make-form-component-props.type.ts
    http response at back

- should research Pagination Athena component

- research what is a tooltip component

- what is difference between input and input area?

- WHEN UI IS REFACTORED REPLACE CURRENT API WITH CONTRACTS, research how much work would it be and how much would it change current code, if it is to expensive 
    it may be better to leave everything the way it is...
