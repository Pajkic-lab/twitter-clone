/* PRISMA */

prisma is not design to use revert migrations, simply make changes to schema and create new migration.


prisma flow:

in development after schema changes rum prisma generate and after that create migration file and deploy it.
in production run prisma generate before nest build because it adds types to node_modules, after that you can apply migrations.

to my understanding prisma generate command generates types and nest them in node_modules so you can use up-to-date prisma client,
it is separate concern from prisma migration.
