make it work for start

- settle git branches and render

- research node module imports, current problem with data-access and prisma library

- settle tsconfig.base.json file - the problem with this is because i have to create new DTOS and this is out of scope, so this will be
resolved as last thing
    // "strict": true,
    // "strictPropertyInitialization": false,
    // "useUnknownInCatchVariables": true,
    // "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,

- create new branch and refactor data-access lib to node environment so it can accept redux toolkit. Research if this is doable
